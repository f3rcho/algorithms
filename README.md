Algorithms with js

## Linear Search

- O(1) Best case
- O(n) Average
- O(n) Worst case

## Binary Search

- Binary search is a much faster form of search
- Rather than eliminating one element at a time, you can eliminate half of the remaining elements at a time
- Binary search only works on sorted arrays!

## SinglyLinkedList

- Singly Linked Lists are an excellent alternative to arrays when insertion and deletion at the beginning are frequently required.
- Arrays contain a built in index whereas Linked Lists do not.
- The idea of a list data structure that consists of nodes is the foundation for other data structures like Stacks and Queues.

**Big O Complexity**
- Insertion: O(n)
- Removal: It depends. O(1) or O(n)
- Searching: O(n)
- Access: O(n)


Run ts node
```bash
    npx ts-node singly-linked-list.ts
```
