Algorithms with js

## Linear Search

- O(1) Best case
- O(n) Average
- O(n) Worst case

## Binary Search

- Binary search is a much faster form of search
- Rather than eliminating one element at a time, you can eliminate half of the remaining elements at a time
- Binary search only works on sorted arrays!

## SinglyLinkedList

```bash
    npx ts-node singly-linked-list.ts
```
